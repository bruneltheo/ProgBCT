# ProgBCT
This pipeline runs using Matlab© and functions of the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net/) and was developed as part of a doctoral project by Théo Brunel, Matthias Cavelius, Marc Thévenet, and Anne Didier. It analyzes regional cell density data using semi-automated functional connectivity techniques. To use the pipeline, download the entire "Projet_ProgBCT" folder, open MATLAB, run the file named "ProgBCT", and follow the instructions provided in the "Instruction.Manual" document. Example datasets are also available in the "Example".
